# Exploring-Spatiotemporal-Patterns-in-Honey-Bee-Colony-Loss-Across-the-United-States

This project delves into the question of whether bee colony loss varies seasonally and geographically within the United States. We'll analyze data to uncover patterns and group regions based on their characteristic loss behaviors. Effective visualizations will be employed to clearly communicate these findings.

Data Analysis:

Seasonal Variations: We'll analyze bee colony loss data across different Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for the entire country. This can be visualized using a line chart where the x-axis represents years and the y-axis represents colony loss percentage.

Grouping Regions:  Based on the seasonal variations, we'll perform hierarchical clustering to group regions with high loss patterns(Q1 and Q4). The results will be presented using a dendrogram, which is a tree-like structure that visually depicts the hierarchical relationships between regions.

Geographical Variations: We'll examine bee colony loss data across different regions within the US. This can be visualized on a Choropleth map where each state or region is colored based on its average loss percentage (color gradient indicating low to high loss).
