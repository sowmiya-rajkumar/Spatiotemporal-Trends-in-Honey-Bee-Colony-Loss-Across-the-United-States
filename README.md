# Exploring-Spatiotemporal-Patterns-in-Honey-Bee-Colony-Loss-Across-the-United-States

In this project my goal was to explore Bee Colonies dataset and analyze the trends for the below questions.

**Question:** 
Does the impact of bee colony loss vary across different seasons and geographical areas within the United States? 
If so, how can these regions be grouped based on their characteristic bee colony loss patterns? 
Emphasize the findings by employing effective visualization methods.
